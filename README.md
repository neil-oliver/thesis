This project would not be possible without the guidance and feedback of the Parsons MSDV faculty, specifically [Daniel Sauter](https://github.com/danielsauter), [Aaron Hill](https://github.com/aaronxhill) & [Karla Polo-Garcia](https://github.com/KayPolo).
The design direction and visual language was developed in conjunction with [Marisa Asari](https://github.com/marisaruizasari). I encourage you to check out her [amazing thesis project](https://weaponsofmassinjustice.netlify.app).
